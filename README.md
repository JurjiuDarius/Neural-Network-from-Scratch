# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

### This is an implementation of a neural network from scratch. It contains an implementation where the layers were hard-coded, as well as one that is more generalizable.

### I tested this on the MNIST digits dataset. The images are freely available on the internet, which is why I only published the notebook. This project's purpose has been to gain deeper insight into neural networks and maybe help others as well. It is obviously not optimised and is not meant to be used for anything serious.
